# Chemicals-and-Allied-Products-Industrial-analysis

# Summary 
In this project, my teammate and I conducted an in-depth analysis of the Chemicals and Allied Products industry, applying advanced analytical techniques to extract insights and inform strategic decisions. We analyzed the 10-K reports of companies within this industry from 2020, focusing on text-based insights and financial performance metrics. A specific company, NEOGEN CORP, was selected for a detailed case study, where we utilized the Word2Vec model to identify its closest competitors and provide actionable recommendations. The analysis was conducted in Jupyter Notebook, and the process is structured into three main parts:

# Part1:Critical Figures and Facts for the industry
We identified key figures and trends within the industry, addressing the following questions:

1. Which firms have the highest stock prices?
2. What is the geographical distribution of firms within the industry?
3. Which firm experienced the greatest impact during the 2007 Financial Crisis, measured by the percentage drop in stock price from 2007 to 2008?
4. What is the average Return on Assets (ROA) for firms based in the USA?

Our analysis involved extracting and visualizing relevant data to provide a comprehensive overview of the industry's landscape.

# Part2:Text Analysis of the Industry Sector
We performed advanced text analysis on the 10-K reports, including:

1. Text cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accurate results.
2. Word cloud generation to highlight key themes.
3. Use of the Word2Vec model to identify similar terms for keywords of interest.
4. Identification of the top 10 keywords for each firm using two methodologies: word counts and TF-IDF scores.
5. Consolidation of findings to analyze the overall industry’s key terms and trends.

This approach helped us uncover meaningful patterns and insights from textual data across the sector.

# Part3:Firm-Specific Analysis and Strategic Recommendations
We selected NEOGEN CORP as a case study and applied the following analyses:

1. Leveraged the previously trained Word2Vec model to identify NEOGEN CORP’s closest competitors.
2. Calculated key performance indicators (KPIs), such as ROA and stock price, to evaluate the firm's performance.
3. Developed strategic recommendations based on our findings, aimed at improving the firm’s competitive positioning.

By combining financial and text analysis methods, this project offers a holistic view of the Chemicals and Allied Products industry while demonstrating the application of advanced data science techniques to address both sector-wide and firm-specific challenges.
